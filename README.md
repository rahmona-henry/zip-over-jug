# zip-over-jug

## 2nd Group project in EDA

### Why?
The water heater in the kitchen was not working since we started the course, Scully proposed to create something fun to protest and
complain.
Also we were keen to use drap & drop

### Main features
- drag & drop 
- css animation
- using random key words as hashtag to grab photos from flickr (using flickr api) to customize the cups' images
